# Sales Data Clustering with K-Means

## ðŸ“œ Introduction
This project involves performing **customer segmentation** using the **K-Means clustering algorithm** on a sales dataset. The goal is to group customers based on their purchasing behavior, allowing businesses to target specific customer segments more effectively.

The project covers:
- Data preprocessing.
- Implementing K-Means clustering.
- Visualizing customer segments.
- Evaluating the clustering results.

---

## ðŸ’¾ Dataset
The dataset used is **Sales Data.csv**, which contains transactional data of customers. It includes information like:
- **Customer ID**
- **Annual Income**
- **Spending Score**
- **Age**, etc.

---

## ðŸ›  Libraries Used
The project utilizes the following Python libraries:  

- ðŸ“Š **pandas**: For data loading and preprocessing.  
- ðŸ§® **numpy**: For numerical operations.  
- ðŸ“ˆ **matplotlib** / **seaborn**: For data visualization.  
- ðŸ¤– **sklearn (scikit-learn)**: For applying K-Means clustering and data preprocessing.

## ðŸš€ Project Workflow

### âœ… 1. Data Loading
The dataset (`Sales Data.csv`) is loaded using **pandas** into a DataFrame for processing.  

### âœ… 2. Data Preprocessing
- Missing values are checked and handled.
- The data is scaled using **StandardScaler** to normalize the features.

### âœ… 3. Apply K-Means Clustering
- The **K-Means algorithm** is applied to segment customers based on their behavior.  
- The optimal number of clusters is determined using the **Elbow Method**.

### âœ… 4. Dimensionality Reduction (Optional)
- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** is applied to reduce dimensions for easier visualization.  

### âœ… 5. Data Visualization
- Clusters are visualized using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to identify patterns.  
- Scatter plots are used to display how customer segments differ.

## ðŸ“Š Results
The clustering results typically group customers into segments such as:  
- ðŸ’Ž **High-income, high-spending** customers.  
- ðŸ’¸ **Low-income, low-spending** customers.  
- ðŸ“Š **Moderate-income, average-spending** customers.
